					<h3 class="text-center panel-heading">It began innocently enough.</h3>
					<p class="panel-body">What started as a casual affair among friends is now entering its third year as a bona fide annual event. Held the Saturday following the 4th of July each year, the Cape Cod Invitational is a double elimination beirut tournament that brings together friends and family for a glorious afternoon of food, drink, camaraderie and friendly competition.  
						<br/><br/>
					Founded by Kelly Lartigue and Austin Gardner-Smith, the event is a new tradition with ambitions of becoming a Cape Cod institution.
